= Introduction

// TODO - Edit this to suit new creator and that it is a public github repo and where to raise issues
This document is a project report template for the School of Computer Science, University of Lincoln. It should give you some direction and instruction for formatting and presenting your project report. If you have any suggestions or issues, please contact the creator of the template on which this is based, bwilliams\@lincoln.ac.uk or jamesbrown\@lincoln.ac.uk. Currently, this template is designed for undergraduate project reports. However, the template can be modified fairly easily to conform to, for example, an MComp project report.
If you would prefer to use the supplied LNCS LaTeX template, you are welcome to do so.
