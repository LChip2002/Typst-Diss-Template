= Design and Methodology
This section of the dissertation may vary significantly in both structure and content,
depending on the type of project you are undertaking. However, it is expected that
all projects have the following sections:
- Project management
- Risk analysis
The precise structure should be discussed with your supervisor, but some suggestions
for additional sections are given below. The key thing to note here is that irrespective
of the project type, you should justify the choices you’ve made, rather than simply
choosing based on expediency or familiarity.

== Software development projects
If the primary deliverable of your project is a software product, then you should
consider subsections detailing your approaches to the following:
- Software development methodology (e.g., waterfall, scrum)
- Toolsets and machine environments (i.e., the software and hardware used)
- Design (e.g., UML diagrams, database schema, prototypes)
- Testing (i.e., the types of testing used)
This list is not exhaustive. For example, a games design project may include a game
6
design document. However, it must be noted that if your project contains significant
software development work, then most if not all of these sections should be present.

== Research not involving human participants
For some projects, the main deliverables may come in the form of experimental
results. For example, a project comparing several different algorithms may require
little in the way of code, but require considerable experimentation and data analysis.
As such, all methodological choices made should be documented here. Examples
include:
- Dataset acquisition and annotation
- Algorithm/model design and selection
- Parameter tuning
- Performance metrics
Again, this list is not exhaustive, and you should still include relevant sections per-
taining to the software artefact listed in Section 4.1.

== Research involving human participants
For projects involving human participants, you will need to consider a hypothesis or
research question that your project will answer. In addition to the sections outlined
in Section 4.1, you may also need to provide details of:
- Participant recruitment
- Evidence that ethical procedures have been followed
- Study design (including hypotheses/research question as appropriate)
- Statistical analysis (i.e., how you’ll analyse the raw data)
If your study involves data collection by means of questionnaires, you may also wish
to specify the questions here (or refer to them in an appendix).
